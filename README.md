The Predictive Analytics System for Outpatient Appointment Non-Attendance at Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH) was developed to address one of the most pressing operational inefficiencies in modern healthcare — the high rate of missed outpatient appointments, commonly referred to as Did Not Attend (DNA) events. At FSH, DNA rates contribute to wasted clinical capacity, longer waiting times, and lost revenue, while existing mitigation strategies such as overbooking and manual reminders remain reactive and unsustainable. This project delivers a data-driven, machine learning–based predictive system designed to anticipate and prevent non-attendance through intelligent automation and visual analytics.
The project’s core objective was to design and implement a predictive analytics dashboard capable of identifying patients at high risk of missing their scheduled appointments. The system aims to enhance outpatient efficiency, reduce administrative waste, and promote equitable access to care. Using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, the project progressed through problem understanding, data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and system deployment. A de-identified dataset of 92,581 historical outpatient appointments was analysed, incorporating patient demographics, appointment context, and behavioural variables.


Three supervised machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier — were developed and compared. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the best overall performance, with 91.5% accuracy, 92.0% precision, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.952, surpassing published benchmarks (Hamdan & Bakar, 2023; Valero-Bover et al., 2022). The model’s robustness and interpretability make it suitable for clinical deployment.

The trained model was integrated into a Streamlit-based predictive dashboard, creating a user-friendly, interactive web application that connects machine learning with operational decision support. The dashboard features real-time risk prediction, colour-coded patient stratification (Low – Green, Moderate - Yellow, High - Red), calendar-based analytics, bulk prediction processing, and a self-retraining function to adapt to new data. It also includes a secure, role-based authentication system for administrators and users, aligning with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and My Health Records Act (2012).
Key innovations include the DNS Risk Scoring Algorithm, which translates model outputs into interpretable 0–100 risk scores, and an integrated calendar view visualising daily and monthly non-attendance trends. A self-retraining capability ensures continuous model improvement, while bulk data processing allows hospital-wide forecasting.

Practically, the system enables hospital administrators to identify high-risk patients in advance, prioritise reminder calls or SMS alerts, and optimise clinic scheduling. Evidence suggests that predictive reminders can reduce no-shows by up to 40% (Oikonomidi et al., 2022), translating into substantial financial savings and improved patient access.


In summary, this project successfully demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be applied to healthcare operations to move from reactive management to predictive, preventive, and equitable care delivery. The system provides a scalable foundation for integration across the Fiona Stanley Fremantle Hospital Group (FSFHG) and the Western Australian public health network, aligning with Australia’s National Digital Health Strategy (2022–2032) and setting a benchmark for intelligent hospital analytics.
